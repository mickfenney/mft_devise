  # Include RMagick or ImageScience support:
  include CarrierWave::RMagick unless RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mingw/i

  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :s3

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url
  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  # end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  process :scale => [600, 600] unless RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mingw/i

  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  unless RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mingw/i
    version :thumb do
      process :resize_to_limit => [150, 150]
    end
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
  # end
